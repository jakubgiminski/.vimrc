# Vim Configuration
This is a personalised config of terminal Vim. It contains basic mappings, and applies a color theme.
Feel free to use it as a base and bend it to your needs.

### Installation 
Once you clone the repo, you need to symlink `vim` folder and the `vimrc` file to `~/.vim` and `~/.vimrc`, accordingly.
This way, whenever Vim wants to load config, it will be pointed to the files from this repo.

To create symlinks, just run something like this:
```
ln -s path/to/repo/vim-config/vim ~/.vim
```
```
ln -s path/to/repo/vim-config/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
